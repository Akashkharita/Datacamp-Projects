# 🚗 Analyzing Car Reviews with LLMs 🤖

## 📋 Project Overview

This project, **Analyzing Car Reviews with LLMs**, is a DataCamp project that explores how large language models (LLMs) can be applied to extract insights from car review data. The scenario is based on the needs of **Car-ing is sharing**, an auto dealership company aiming to better understand their customers' feedback through advanced NLP techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📝 **Analyze car review texts** to extract actionable insights.
- 😀 **Classify sentiment** (positive, negative, neutral) from review data.
- 🧠 **Language Translation** (english to espaniol) for non native english speakers
- 💡 **Question Answer Extractionr** for quick insights
- 🏳️ **Summarization** Summarizing long reviews for efficiency and quick grasp

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common ML/NLP libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, [transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) (if using LLMs), etc.

Install dependencies (example):

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyter transformers
```

### 📦 Data

The dataset consists of car reviews collected from customers. Data fields may include:

- `review_text`
- `rating`
- `car_model`
- Other metadata (as available)

*Note: Please ensure data privacy if using real customer data.*

## ⚡ Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Akashkharita/Datacamp-Projects.git
    cd Datacamp-Projects/Artificial-Intelligence/analyzing_car_reviews_llm
    ```
2. Launch the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
    ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to explore the data, run sentiment analysis, and interpret the results.

## 🛠️ Methods

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualize and summarize the review data.
- 🧹 **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, cleaning, and vectorization.
- 🏷️ **Sentiment Classification:** Using traditional ML models and/or LLMs (e.g., GPT, BERT).
- 📈 **Evaluation:** Accuracy, F1-score, and other relevant metrics.

## 📊 Results

- Insights into customer sentiment for various car models.
- Identification of key areas for service improvement.
- Demonstration of LLM effectiveness for real-world text analysis.
